# Working-With-Data-Structures-Heaps
This program creates a heap data structure and tests its functionality. 

This was a school project and my portion of the code is found in the file 'min_heap.c'.

Functions to allow the heap to work as intended were the following:
heapify_up: Move a value from a source up to its correct location,  
heapify_down: Move a value from a source down to its correct location, 
min_heap_initialize: Initialize the heap, 
min_heap_free: Free the heap of any nodes when the program is done running, 
min_heap_heapify: Fill the heap, 
min_heap_insert: Insert a node into the heap, 
min_heap_remove: Remove a node from the heap, 
min_heap_valid: Check if the heap is valid or if it needs adjusting, 
min_heap_replace: Replace the smallest value in the heap with a new value, 
heap_sort: Sort the heap into a valid order, 
min_heap_print: print the results of the heap. 

Some other functions can also be found that perform small tasks such as checking the number of nodes in the heap, check if its empty or full, or peak at the root value.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my program!
